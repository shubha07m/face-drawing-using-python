# face-drawing-using-python
This is a fun program for constructing a series of faces with python.
In this program I have used a raw .txt file which was having 3 sets of coordinates (x,y,z) of 100 significant points of a human face, 
obtained from a video recording. Now, this program can generate a number of images as per the number of frames used (one image per frame), 
it is possible either to save those images separately or make a video or a gif file using them.

Value:
This program is a good tool to visualize the changes in a human face during a dialogue. A paper "Grammatical facial expressions recognition 
with machine learning" by Fernando de Almeida FreitasSarajane Marques PeresSarajane Marques PeresClodoaldo A M LimaClodoaldo A M LimaFelipe
